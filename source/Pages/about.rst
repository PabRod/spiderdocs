.. _best-suited-cases:

=================
Best suited cases
=================

The best-suited cases for :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` are scientific projects with a requirement to process
relatively large data sets. For example research projects suitable for :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` that deal with massive datasets are commonly in:
Genomics, Proteomics, Earth observation, Astronomical observation, Climate modeling,
Engineering or Physics experiments.

You would be eligible for :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` if your project reflects some of the following needs:

* Processing of large amount of data of many terabytes to petabytes in short time spans
* Processing of large amount of independent simulations and workflows
* Interactive processing with user-friendly interfaces for efficient data handling
* Industry standard interfaces and other interoperability features
* Co-working with your collaborators on the same project-based workspace
* Accessing external storage facilities with fast connectivity

Also :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` is a viable alternative for current and potential
medium tail `Grid`_ users. It is a low-threshold platform, as opposed to highly
complex Grid platforms that take many months of specialist development
before they can start. Being built upon the exact same physical data-processing
infrastructure and sharing the same scalable network connectivity as the classical
Grid-based processing environments, :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` offers the same data-parallel processing
capabilities as the most powerful Grid platforms.

Note though that while it's great for such data-intensive applications,
:abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` is *not* really aimed at:

* HPC applications where operations per second are critical
* Processing of simulations that require multi-node execution
* Applications that cannot be ported on Linux-based system


.. _collaboration:

=============
Collaboration
=============

:abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` is designed for Big Science which essentially requires
collaboration. :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` supports several ways to collaborate, either
within your project, or across different projects or by connecting to external sources
in a seamless manner.

.. _project-space:

Project space
=============

When you come to use :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` you do so in the context of a project. Every user
of the platform is member of a project and every project in :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` gets an individual workspace where the project members
can collaborate by sharing data, software or workflows. This workspace is called
*project space* and it is offered by default to every project.

Collaborative groups often have members that have different roles and
mandates. Although standard unix has basic features to organize groups, :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` natively provides templates for sophisticated group
organization in the context of a project. For example, a :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` project may have a leader who decides on privileges
of other members, members who are designated software developers or administrators,
or members who manage data dissemination, and of course the scientific users who focus on
their data analysis and visualization.

At the start of your :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` project, you just need to select the appropriate
configuration to get going.  As a project member you are assigned at least one
of the following roles:

* *technical lead* role: the contact person for any technical matters that affect the design and execution of the project and the privileges of other members
* *data manager* role: designated data dissemination manager; responsible for the management of project-owned data
* *software manager* role: designated software manager; responsible to install and maintain the project-owned software
* *normal user* role: scientific users who focus on their data analysis

.. _scientific-catalog:

Scientific catalog
==================

Collaboration is also possible across different :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` projects. These are cases where different user groups work
on projects with different scope and goals but need to (partly) share read-only data
(such as observations, biobank data). :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` offers a place for multiple project teams to
collaborate. This workspace is called *scientific catalog* and it is *not* offered by default to a project.

The scientific catalog data can be either *open* to everyone on the platform or *private* to
selected :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` project groups.

The scientific catalog has only one (but important) role:

* *scientific catalog manager*: designated data dissemination :abbr:`SC (scientific catalog)` manager; responsible for populating the catalog and deciding which :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data Extraction and Redistribution)` project groups have read access to the catalog.


.. _  interoperability-hotspot:

Interoperability hotspot
========================

In contrast to many of the processing platforms already available,
typically offering an all-inclusive solution within the boundaries of the their
environment, :abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` is exactly the opposite. It aims to be a connecting
platform in a world that has already a lot to offer in terms of storage systems,
data distribution and collaboration frameworks, software management and portability
systems, and pilot job and task management frameworks. The Spider platform hooks
them all together as an interoperability hotspot to support a variety of data
processing and data collaboration use cases.

For all external services supported, even services owned by the users themselves,
:abbr:`Spider (Symbiotic Platform(s) for Interoperable Data
Extraction and Redistribution)` offers optimized configurations
and practical guidelines how to connect to these services together
into a practical processing environment tailored specifically to each project.
